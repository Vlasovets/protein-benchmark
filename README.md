# Protein-Based Predictive Modeling Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to identify key protein biomarkers and build predictive models using proteomics and demographic data. It consists of the following main stages:

## 1. Feature Selection

**Input:** A dataset with p proteins measured across N individuals.

### Step 1 – Differential Expression Filtering:
Initially, differential expression analysis is conducted to identify proteins that are significantly associated with the outcome or condition of interest. This filters proteins down to a more relevant subset (e.g., ~1,000 proteins).

### Step 2 – Random Forest Importance Ranking:
A random forest classifier is used to rank the remaining proteins by their importance, based on their contribution to model accuracy.

### Step 3 – Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):
A recursive feature elimination process is applied to iteratively remove the least important proteins, resulting in a final set of ~8 top predictive proteins.

## 2. Model Building

### Features Used:
The final model incorporates:
- The selected top ~8 proteins
- Demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, etc.)

### Modeling Techniques:
Multiple machine learning models are tested, such as:
- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- XGBoost

## 3. Model Evaluation

### Validation Strategy:
A hold-out test set comprising 10% of the original data is used to evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability.

### Metrics:
- AUC
